# Project Description

This project is a remake of the well known game of chess. The game allows for a user to play against someone else by alternating mouse clicks. Our project works the same as the normal game of chess, including illegal moves, castling, en passant, pawn promotion, check/checkmate and also stalemate detection. Running the project displays a chess board on screen with the arranged pieces.
